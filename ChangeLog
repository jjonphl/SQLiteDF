- updated version to 0.1.13

2006-08-21 (9:30 Manila)

2006-08-18  Douglas Bates  <bates@R-project.org>
       * R/All.R (with.sqlite.data.frame, summary.sqlite.vector,
       as.logical.sqlite.vector, as.integer.sqlite.vector,
       as.double.sqlite.vector): Modify calling sequence of S3 methods to
       correspond to generic.
       * man/sqlite.data.frame.Rd: add keywords

2006-08-18 (6:05pm Manila time)
- fixed R-devel tests failure
- removed Depends on biglm, DBI. used namespace qualifiers 
- added ChangeLog
- added tests on summary
- added version in DESCRIPTION, starting at 0.1.11

2006-08-17
- fix on USE_SDF1 bug, when a function uses 2 sdf's the 1st may be unloaded 
  because of low use count
- fix on transactions
- started implementing sqlite.matrix
- commented out parts of the test that fails due to "minor technicalities" (precision, NA). will test them again...
- summary works, almost the same as original df except for NA handling

2006-08-11
- added sdflm, as.data.frame.sdf, eval, sdfImportDBI, sdfImportSQLite
- added Requires DBI, biglm in DESCRIPTION
- corrected generic-ized is.list, length (already generic)
- added "begin", "commit" in sdf_create_sdf, rbind, and row ops. absence of
  which was the cause of the slowness
- factored out _prepare_attach2() w/c checks the # of attached sqlite db's
  and detaches as necessary.
- fixed bug on detecting R character type, STRSXP instead of CHARSXP
- added utility _str_tolower(), file name & line number in _sqlite_error
- override stats::quantile env
- change Makevars to link statically

2006-08-01
- added methods is.list and as.list to sdf's. lapply (sapply) now works
- rbind(sdf, df) works, however no "labeled" rbind
- finished Op group (%% & %/% implemented wrongly for now...)
- with.sqlite.data.frame is already working
- sort.sqlite.vector() is working
- renamed USE_SDF to USE_SDF1, restricted it to only use buf1 and below.
  there was something affected by this, which calls USE_SDF twice (initially
  i thought it would only be used on top of funcs, so using all buffers is
  ok. if you use it in the middle of the func, it would overwrite all buffers).
- fixed sdf_get_row_count, _create_svector1 (renamed from *2, added ordered),
  renamed _create_sdf_skeleton2 to skeleton1 because it uses USE_SDF1,
  changed _get_row_count2 to have quoted and non-quoted option
- added tests

2006-07-17
- added documentation
- finished Summary group, cummulative stuffs in Math group for sqlite.vector
- revised tests to use stop()
- started rbind for data frames

  attached db
- added USE_SDF, w/c does the juggling of which db to be attached

2006-07-10
- moved libsqlite3.* to inst/sqlite/linux, added inst/sqlite/win to have
  sqlite windows static dll
- change libsqlite3.a to have 31 max attach-ed db's
- most of Math.sqlite.vector is working already
- fixed sdf_attach_sdf
- factored out creation of sdf in _create_sdf_skeleton2
- added dupSdf, renameSdf

2006-07-05
